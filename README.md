# Facial Recognition License Verification System

The project is a system that predicts license details using Machine Learning and Facial Recognition.

Trained a Naive Bayes classifier to predict license status and generate alerts for expired or missing licenses.

## How to do

From the images folder download all the 51 images. Each of the image is labelled with license number.

Now in the mocktest.csv edit the last column. Add the local address of the image corresponding to each detail of the driving license. Make sure you add the address of image to the row with the same driving license number.

Delete remaining rows of data where there is no corresponding image, or just add some random image.

Now the dataset is ready. Similarly you can make necessary changes to the code ad then execute the code.
